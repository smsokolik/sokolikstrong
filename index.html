            <p>In May of 2016, my son Lucas was diagnosed with Crohn’s Disease. Lucas’s battle hasn’t been easy and as a family we have decided we are going to continue to fight with Lucas to raise money, be a resource to others and learn as much as we can about this disease. Our hope is that there will be better treatments or a cure in his lifetime and until that happens we will remain strong. </p>

                  <p>“Should he be working?”, “It’s just drive-thru and take-out”, “I will feel terrible if he gets sick at work”, “He loves his job”. My mind was racing with concerns last week about Lucas working his part-time job.  Having a child who is immunosuppressed during the Coronavirus outbreak has caused some added concerns in our household. After talking to his provider (Suggested by Lucas!) we decided because he is at a higher risk of infection that he take a leave of absence.<br>Lucas, his younger brother, Joe and I will continue to school from home and pray that this passes and those who are unable to stay at home and are immunocompromised are kept safe. My family would like to thank all those who continue to work so that we are able to have what we need. </p>
